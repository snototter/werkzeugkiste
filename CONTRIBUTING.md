<!--
**TODO** adjust auto-generated doc!

    Short overview, rules, general guidelines, notes about pull requests and
    style should go here.

TODO merge code of conduct into here
-->

* For each library, there should be a demo binary within `examples/`  
  Note, however, that demos are the lowest priority features on my list for
  this toolbox. Most importantly, this library should keep a high code
  coverage!
<!-- TODO update
TODO automate consumer use cases
TODO make it more easily testable

* Ensure it is working with:
  * `cmake -Dwerkzeugkiste_WITH_EXAMPLES=ON`
  * `examples/cmake-fetch`
  * `examples/installed-locally`

## Getting started

Helpful notes for developers can be found in the [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md)

suggests.
